# 👋 Hello, I’m Ștefan-Teodor Vișinescu

I build end-to-end systems at the intersection of mobile health, passive sensing, and AI/ML, with experience in privacy-preserving learning (federated), cloud backends (Azure), and clinical-grade analytics.
This profile highlights selected projects in stochastic modelling, RNA-seq pipelines, IoT engineering, and industry applications.
